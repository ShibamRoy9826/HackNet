## FAQ
### Why should I use this app? and not slack?
Short answer, vibes, I totally agree with the fact that slack is probably better than HackNet(as of now) if you want to chat or do anything for that matter. But that probably won't give you the vibes similar to reddit, instagram or other apps, I wanted to make something that gives similar vibes to them. For now it doesn't have too many features but that never means that it won't have more features/equivalent features to slack in the future. UI can be another factor, and for messaging I often find slack is too sluggish(Not like my app is too fast, but at least it feels less sluggish, likely cause it doesn't have anywhere near the amount of data most likely). To be honest, the best I can explain is that "I made it", and that's a reason why I want you to use it!

### New features when?
After a break, I can't give any estimate, whenever I have free time, OR You can make them too! I would love it if you could contribute to this app:)

### What features will be added in the future?
- E2E encrypted chats, Yes I know that's a very big drawback as of now, chats are NOT end to end encrypted, But I assure that I will fix that soon.
- Replies to comments
- Dislike buttons -> Should be easy but I am not making it now, cause it looks messy, I want to keep it minimal for now
- Any feature that you all demand, all I need is free time, you can open an issue to request a new feature. 

## Contribution
You can contribute by raising an issue or making a pull request, I will happily review them and merge them asap:)
